## Definition of distributed system  
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that
appears to its users as a single coherent system.

## 4 Goals of dsitributes system
- A distributed system should make resources easily accessible.
- It should reasonably hide the fact that resources are distributed across a network. 
- It should be open. 
- It should be scalable.

## Characterstics of Decentralize Algorithm
- No machine has complete information about the system state.
- Machines make decisions based only on local information.
- Failure of one machine does not ruin the algorithm.
- There is no implicit assumption that a global clock exists.

##  Scaling Techniques of Distributed System
- Hiding communication latencies
