# React Components and Props Core Concept

<b>2 types of component in react</b>
- Functional Component
- Class Component ( <b>class must have inherit <u>React.Component</u> class</b> )

<b>N.B:</b> Never change <u>props inside class component's render function</u>. Because it wil re-render again and again and will cause an infinite loop.
