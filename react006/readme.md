# Inheritance and Composition

## Problems with Inheritance

- components are tightly coupled
- from child, it's not clear what parent does
- not clear about the parent child relation


<b>N.B: </b> That's why react suggest us to use composition.

## Composition

- All components can be used independently.
- loosely coupled components

<b>N.B: </b> For maintainability one should inherit only React.Component class while using a class component.
