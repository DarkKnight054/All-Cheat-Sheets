# Higher Order Components

- A higher-order component is a function that takes a component as a parameter
and returns a new component. 

- higher-order components start with <b><u>with</u></b> - Naming convention.

<h3>Why HOC?</h3>

- basically, we can do this using lifting state up to parent component but then many other components might have to take the props with them which is useless
because of reacts unidirection data flow.
