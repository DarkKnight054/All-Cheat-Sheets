## Generic Research Pathways

1. Problem Identification
2. Reviewing information
3. Two approaches:

- Data centric: proposal/ Datacollection / Experiment
- System centric: Proposal / Design / Development

4. Analysis
5. Drawing conclusions

### Problem Identification

- Beginning of the research study
- Most difficult and important step
- Identify and state the problem clearly

### Reviewing Information

<b>Reading the works of others before starting your own research work<b>

Predatory journal - publish papers within few days without pre review for exchange of money

Read paper that match with your topic or relevant topic.

Search the publisher-specific digital libraries:

- Publishers: Wiley, springer,Elsevier
- Professional Societies: ACM, IEEE
- Online archives: www.arXiv.com

### Defining problem

- Write a research statement
- Write it within two to three lines.(also one line can be possible)
- Break research statements into functional chunks of research objectives or research questions
- Goal for the thesis would be to fulfil each research objective or to answer each reseach question in different chapters of your thesis.

## Core Methodology

### Threat Modelling

There is no absolute security in the world.

**Threat modeling is the approach for identifying threats in the system.**

#### To model threats, we could use the STRIDE approach:

STRIDE:

- Spoofing: Attacker use the resource of a system using another's identity.
- Tampering: Tamper data of the system.
- Repudiation: When a bad actor performs an illegal or malicious operation in a system and then denies their involvement with the attack.
- Information Disclosure: It happens when an application or website unintentionally reveals data to unauthorized users.
- Denial of Service(DoS): Deny service to valid users.
- Elevation of privileges: Access control to the system.

Additional security threat:

- Replay: Replay a particular request.
- Privacy threat

### Requirement analysis

- Functional requirements: Requires to function the system properly.
- Non-functional requrements:
  - Security requirements
  - Privacy requirements

### Architechture Design

**Designing the high-level architechture of the system**
**Make architechtural design among different entities and components.**

Architechture should designed in such a way so that it can satisfy all the requirements.

### Protocol flow

**Specifies how the different entities and components communicate with each other**

We need to detail out different data that will be passed within each request and response among different entities.

### Development

In system-centric research, design and developent is must.
In development process, inconsistencies in the protocol flow can be found and they can be fixed.

### Use-Case

You will need to discuss each use-case in your report with appropriate set of screen-shots.

## Analysis

- Requirement Evaluation
- Perfomance Evaluation
- Security Evaluation (if researchers have enough time)
- Usability Evaluation (if researchers have enough time)

## Conclusion

Examine The research objectives or questions your work:

- Have you fulfilled all abectives or questions?
  - If yes, explain how
  - If not, explain why not

Compare your works with the existing works. If any:

- Add a comparisn table with others work

How to extend your work?

- what is the potential future work?

You can highlight the challenges you have faces.
